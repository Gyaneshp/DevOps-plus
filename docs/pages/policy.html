    <p>As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:</p>
    <pre>>> print("Hello, World!")<br>Hello, World!</pre>
    <p>Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:</p>
    <pre>C:\Users\Your Name&gt;python myfile.py</pre>
    <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
    <p>DevOps Engineers, SRE, System administrators and IT professionals can use it as a work reference. But YOU ARE responsible yourself for using the commands and materials shared here. As every different environment and set up may work differently. Read the Policy page for more.</p>
    <p>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.</p>
    <p>Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</p>
